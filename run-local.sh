# Usage:
#   ./run-local.sh
#
# Need:
# - Users will need to update the backend/ocpperf.toml file to meet their needs.
#
# TBD:
# - Add a way to automatically configure the functional test OpenSearch database
#   snapshots with the appropriate ocpperf.toml file, which may be useful for
#   testing.
