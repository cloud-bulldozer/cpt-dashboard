"""Set up Opensearch for functional tests

The functional test Opensearch instance has a "golden" snapshot called
"functional" in the designated snapshot directory. We need to call
Opensearch APIs to establish that snapshot repository and restore the
snapshot. Since the Opensearch is started in an isolated pod, we can't
script this from outside the pod; so we run this little Python program
inside the Opensearch container.
